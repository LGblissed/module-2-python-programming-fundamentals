## ‚≠ê Conclusion on Module 2

#### The theory displayed was more concise and focused on problem solving, rational thinking, and clearly understanding the way of approaching problems through conditional statements or looping.  

#### They show a very intuitive way of thinking, and there was more code involved also, so it was a better module in my opinion.  

#### They also present lists and what they can actually do to manage data and how to play with it, but they keep it sharp and intuitive so it is easy to understand.  

#### I think this module is very well proposed and the theory was very direct and rational. **I liked it.**
